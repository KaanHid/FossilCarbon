# Data 
All data related to Exiobase datasets (except deflator data, waste coefficients, and lifetime data) were obtained through https://zenodo.org/records/10148587 and https://zenodo.org/record/3583071#.X0jqmGjVJPZ. Other files were directly obtained through the Exiobase team.
'Exiobase_Monetary_Hybrid_Concordance.xlsx' is the concordance for country orders between hybrid and monetary SUT tables.
'Deflator2011base.xlsx' is the deflator data from Exiobase 3 team for 1995-2016, with base year converted to 2011, also adjusted the countries to the ordering of the monetary dataset.
'Figure 1 - gh.xlsx', 'Figure 2 -gh.xlsx','Figure 3', and 'Figure 4 -gh' hold the intermadiary data to construct figures 1-4.
'Durable_Acc_Discharge.m' is the matlab code to estimate the discharge of fossil carbon in durables for 1995-2019.
'Lifetime_funct_all_exiobase.xlsx' has the lifetime distribution data of all products in exiobase.
'Classifications_v_3_3_18.xlsx' has the necessary information to classify countries, products, and sectors.
'exio_transfer_coeff.xlsx' holds the data regarding embodied materials in activities/processes in Exiobase 3.
'capital_calculation' contains the matlab code for calculating embodied materials and stock build-up in sectors
'DurablestoWasteTreatment'contains the matlab code for estimating the treatment of fossil carbon durables in different waste treatment options
'MonteCarlo_EoL.m', 'MonteCarlo_GAS.m', and 'MonteCarloWasteTreatment' are the matlab codes for conducting Monte Carlo analysis on results related to end-of-life flows, gross addition to stocks of durables, and waste treatment, respectively.
